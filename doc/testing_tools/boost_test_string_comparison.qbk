[section:strings C-string comparison]
In the general case, pointers are compared using their value. However when type of the the pointers are `char*` or `wchar_t*`, 
__BOOST_TEST__ promotes them as null terminated `char` arrays and string comparison is used instead. 

[tip In this form, the comparison method and reporting can be overridden an additional argument to __BOOST_TEST__.
 See the [link boost_test.testing_tools.extended_comparison.collections collection comparison] section for more details, in particular
 `boost::test_tools::per_element()` and `boost::test_tools::lexicographic()` modifiers.]
